Week 4 Progress Check
==================
Contained in this repo is the work that an independent developer did for Fran and Frank's restaurant. Unfortunately this developer wasn't able to complete the contract and below are the remaining tasks. The tasks cover the material we've gone over for the past three weeks and should be familiar to you at this point in the term. If you feel uncomfortable with any of these please see the learning resources under the task for help.
